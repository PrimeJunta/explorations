        <h1>How does this work?</h1>
        <p>I recurse through the source text, break up all text nodes
          into spans, one per word. Then I inject these nodes into the
          columns, and check after each word if the marginBox of the
          column's content node is still smaller than the contentBox of
          the column. If not, I remove what I just added, construct the
          wrappers it needs, and continue placing in the next column,
          starting with the newly-created node containing those parts of
          the source data that didn't fit.</p>
        <p>The advantage of this approach is that I don't need to know
          anything about the source text nor the target columns since I'm
          not actually measuring anything; I'm checking after placing
          anything whether it worked or not, and stepping back if it
          didn't. The results might not look identical across all
          browsers, but the flow will work.</p>

        <p>Flowing images with computed sizes is problematic and
          doesn't always work. To really make it robust I'd have to add a
          timeout every time after injecting an image and check the DOM
          only after it's expired. This would require making the flow
          algorithm asynchronous, which would slow things down a good
          deal. You can avoid this by specifying a fixed height and width
          for any in-flow images in the source data.</p>
        <h1>What's Not In</h1>
        <p>This is a poorly-optimized proof of concept and no doubt
          has a bunch of bugs. I believe the principle is sound though.</p>

        <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
          Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in
          American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that
          in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in
          American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.</p>

        <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
          show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people
          who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide
          if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and
          become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She
          starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

        <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
          plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do
          you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face
          sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you
          put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy
          store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're
          here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>
  
        <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
          don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass
          motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks.
          Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass,
          'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?</p>
  
        <h1>Are you ready for the truth?</h1>
        <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
          chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
          transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you.
          But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides,
          I've already been through too much shit this morning over this
          case to hand it over to your dumb ass.</p>
